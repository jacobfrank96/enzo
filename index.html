        <p class="lead">My name is Enzo. Ever since a young age I have had a passion for watching and caring for children.
        As the oldest of all of my cousins it was always my duty to take care of the people younger than me.
        I have had experience in babysitting/house sitting for over a decade, as well as private art and Japanese tutoring over the course of a few years. I am an artist and thoroughly enjoy helping kids reach their full creative potential.
        My previous job was at a children's clothing store.</p>
